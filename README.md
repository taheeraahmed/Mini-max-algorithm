# Minimax algorithm
This is an assignment from the course TDT4136 Introduction to Artifical Intelligence. Here we were supposed to implement the Alpha-Beta pruning and minimax algorithm. We used a pacman game to illustrate how the algorithm works. It was pretty dope

The code for the algorithms can be found in `multiAgent.py`
